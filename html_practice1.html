        Everything that we see and feel around us such as trees, plants, animals, the aroma of flowers, the sweetness of fruit, and any other products that are manufactured by the earth is collectively called Nature. Itâ€™s a non-returnable blessing to mankind. Nature can also be mentioned as the phenomenon which takes place around us daily like the flowing of water, the sense of cold air, and the birds chirruping we hear. Healthy and wealthy nature is very important for the well-being of humans. However, it can also show you its worst negative side. If you want the best from nature, just give it the best you can.
